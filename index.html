       <h1><i>Fun with Fourier</i></h1>
        
        <div style="display:block; width:650px;">
            <h3><i>Introduction</i></h3>
            
            <p>
            There are hundreds of modern technologies, from the compression that is
            used to store digital images from your phone to the generation of musical
            notes in a digital piano, that make use of <i>Fourier transformations</i>.
            But, what is a Fourier transformation? Put simply, the Fourier transform is
            a series of mathematical procedures which allow you to take any signal and
            discover <i>what underlying frequencies it is made of</i>. This is well 
            demonstrated by an animation from Lucas V. Barbosa (available, Creative Commons):
            </p>
            
            <img src="ft.gif" width="300" style="margin-left:150px;" />
            
            <p>
            Essentially, understanding what frequencies need to be added together to form
            a given wave (in red in the above animation) allows the creation of a
            <i>frequency space</i> (in blue in the above animation). By performing
            changes to a signal in frequency space, it is possible to do things such
            as removing only frequencies which are high or low. This is easier to think
            about with sound: have you ever listened to music on a bad pair of headphones
            and noticed that there is no bass? This is the result of an operation known as
            a <i>high pass filter</i>, where (in this case unintentionally) all of the
            low-frequency portions of the signal have been removed, leaving only the high-frequency
            signals. This same type of understanding can be extended to images, 
            however, it can be hard to visualize due to the signals no longer being nice 1-dimensional
            lines. In this demo, we will: A) produce 2D fourier transforms from images; and B)
            show how these fourier transforms can be manipulated.

            <h3><i>The Demo</i></h3>
            
            <p>
            The demo at the bottom of this page is a simulation of a very simple experiment,
            which is diagrammed below:
